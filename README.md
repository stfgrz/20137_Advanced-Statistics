## Brief Description
  The following files are the mere transcriptions, with minimal editing, of what Professor Boella (ESS20) says in class.

## How to access the PDF
  The .pdf file on github is not constantly uptaded; to obtain your own version, download 
  1. all the .tex lecture files, starting with L1
  2. preamble.tex
  3. main.tex (will be uploaded shortly)
  Upload everything on an Overleaf file and compile; if runtime is >1min, you would need to download VS Code.
  If you don't know how to download/use VS code, you can compile each lecture by itself.
